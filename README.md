# Personal Analytics Project â€” SQL & Python

This is an **entry-level portfolio project**, done in **Google Colab** (Python) and **DBeaver** (SQL), connected together by **Supabase**.

This project shows:
- âœ… How to design and build a simple **Data Warehouse (DWH)** schema with `dim` and `fact` tables.
- âœ… How to run **SQL analytics queries** to gain insights (e.g., sales by country, genre, or employee performance).
- âœ… How to use **Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)** to pull data from Supabase, transform it, and push new results back.
- âœ… How to integrate a **currency exchange API** for real-time conversions.
- âœ… How to visualize results with **Matplotlib**.

**Tech Stack:**  
- PostgreSQL (Supabase)  
- Google Colab  
- DBeaver  
- Python: Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Requests, Matplotlib

**Purpose:**  
ðŸ“Š Practice designing a small DWH, writing SQL analytics, automating ETL with Python, and connecting tools together for end-to-end data workflows.
